# Rap Rater
A small app that will practice the core concepts of React!

With this project you will:
- Understand how to design a project into composable components
- Implement state inside of components
- Utilize React lifecycle methods
- Practice Event Handling

# Deliverables
- When the app loads up, we want to display a list of rappers
- When the user clicks on a rapper image, it should switch between happy and sad photos

# Questions we want to ask ourselves when we are designing applications
- "What are the components that make this user interface? How can I break them down?"
- "Where should state live for this particular piece of functionality?"
- "Does state need to be shared among components?"
- "What happens to make the state change?"

# Words of Wisdom
- The function that changes state needs to be defined in the same place that state is defined; it doesn't need to be in the same place that it **executed**
